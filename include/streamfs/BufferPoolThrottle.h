/*
 * This class implements throttle logic to facilitate a mechanism used for
 * ensuring that the rate at which buffers can be read from the TSB are
 * aligned with the rate at which they injected into the TSB for a certain
 * buffer chunk position.
 *
 * The class implements a throttle loop, which maintains a throttle position index
 * (mThrottleIndex), indicating the current buffer chunk being throttled. For a
 * certain throttle position index, it fetches the associated period from the
 * time period buffer (mTimePeriodBuffer). This time period indicates the delta
 * time relative to the arrival of the previous buffer chunk and is used for
 * initiating a blocking sleep.
 *
 * When the sleep completes, the throttle index is incremented and the procedure
 * is repeated in a loop. This procedure ensures that the rate at which
 * mThrottleIndex is incremented thereby follows the rate at which buffers are
 * pushed to the buffer pool, which is used in conjunction facilitating the
 * throttling.
 *
 * The class provides the following method related to the throttling:
 *
 * - registerTimePeriod: sample-and-register buffer chunk period time which will
 *   be pushed to the time period buffer. Shall be called whenever a new buffer
 *   chunk is received.
 *
 * - setReadPosition: sets the read positions targeting for throttling.
 *
 * - wait: executes the actual throttling for the read position set. The method
 *   will block until the throttle index is larger than the read position.
 *
 * See method description for further elaboration.
